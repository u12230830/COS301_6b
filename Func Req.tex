\section{Create BuzzSpace}
\subsection*{Description:}This use case encapsulates the ability for a user to create a new BuzzSpace that will be associated with a specific acitve module. 
Each BuzzSpace will have a root thread to start with. The creator of the BuzzSpace will set properties of the BuzzSpace (i.e which status is needed for a user 
to do what). 
\subsection{Prioritization:}Critical
\subsection{Conditions and Data Structures:}
\subsubsection*{Pre-Conditions:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The user wanting to create a new BuzzSpace should be logged in to the system and should be registered with the module for which he/she wants to
	create the BuzzSapce. 
	\item The user should have a high enough status to be allowed to create a BuzzSpace (i.e. lecturer status).
	\item The module for which the BuzzSpace is being created must be an active module at that time.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Post-Conditions:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A message is displayed to inform the creator of the BuzzSpace that the creation has been successful. Users can now start more threads on this BuzzSpace.
	\item If this service has been rejected, an exceoption is thrown and an error message will be displayed to the user.

\section{Read BuzzSpace}
\subsection*{Description:}This use case includes the ability to view BuzzSpaces, this is, to view the different threads in the BuzzSpace (and thus have acces to them), and also to view the
properties of the specific BuzzSpace (i.e. the permissions that were set, date of creation and the creator of this thread).
\subsection{Prioritization:} Critical
\subsection{Conditions and Data Structures:}
\subsubsection*{Pre-Conditions:}None 
\subsubsection*{Post-Conditions:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Threads can now be viewed and accessed, and the properties can also be viewed.

\section{Summarise Thread}
\subsection*{Description:}
Since a thread can, in theory, grow infinitely long, It is therefor necessary to show only the important aspects of the thread. These are the root post in the thread, the declared answer in the thread and the thread's social tags.\\
\subsection{Prioritization:}
This feature is Nice-To-Have. The system will not be immensly devalued if this feature is not added.\\ 
\subsection{Conditions and Data Structures:}
\subsubsection*{Pre-Conditions:}
1.	The thread must be closed (No longer open for discussion).\\
2.	User must be logged on as the system administrator to summarise a thread.\\
3.	The thread must be more than 3 posts long.\\
\subsubsection*{Post-Conditions:}
1.	The thread is summarised successfully if all pre-conditions are me.\\
2.	The system displays an error message if at least one of the pre-conditions are violated.\\
\subsubsection*{Requests and Results Data Structures:}
\subsection{Required Functionality:}

\section{Hide Thread}
\subsection*{Description:}
Hiding a thread is when the System administrator makes the thread invisible to the user but not to the system. It is necessary for cases like when a thread is under plagiarism investigations or when the discussion is considered inappropriate. It will still exist in the Buzz space but users will not see it and, in turn, add onto it. \\
\subsection{Prioritization:}
It is considered critical to the system. It remains key that the system maintains its credibility and integrity at all times. This avoids conflicts and legal issues that may arise.\\ 
\subsection{Conditions and Data Structures:}
\subsubsection*{Pre-Conditions:}
1.	The user must be logged on as a system administrator.\\
2.	The thread must have been flagged by the system for plagiarism or other questionable characteristics such as vulgar language or slander.\\
\subsubsection*{Post-Conditions:}
1.	The thread is successfully hidden from the user if all pre-conditions are met.\\
2.	The thread is still visible to the system.\\
3.	A notification is sent to the owner of the thread that it is pending investigation.\\
4.	The thread remains unhidden and an error message is shown if at least one of the pre-conditions aren't met.\\

%JIMMY
\section{Close Thread}
\subsection*{Description:}
Once a best answer has been agreed upon by the thread owner and users, it is no longer necessary for the thread to be open to discussion. It is therefore preferable for it to be available for viewing and not commenting on. It is considered closed when this happens. \\
\subsection{Prioritization:}
This feature is considered important. The system can cope without it but it is not preferable because threads can grow to be very long.\\
\subsection{Conditions and Data Structures:}
\subsubsection*{Pre-Conditions:}
1.	The user must be logged in as an administrator.\\
2.	The a best answer has to have been chosen by the thread owner based on his or her discretion and votes from the users.\\
\subsubsection*{Post-Conditions:}
1.	An error message is shown if at least one of the pre-conditions have been violated.\\
2.	The thread is closed successfully if the pre-conditions have been met or open otherwise.\\

\section{Move Thread}
\subsection*{Description:}
Moving a thread can entail either deleting it from its original Buzz space to a different one or duplicating it. The former is necessary when a thread is not relevant to the Buzz space in question while the latter is important when it is relevant to both.\\
\subsection{Prioritization:} 
\subsection{Conditions and Data Structures:}
\subsubsection*{Pre-Conditions:}
1.	The user must be logged in as an administrator.\\
2.	The thread owner must have given constent for the contents of the thread to be moved.\\
\subsubsection*{Post-Conditions:}
1.	An error message is displayed if the user is not logged on as admin.\\
2.	The thread is successfully moved if both pre-conditions are met.\\
3.	The thread owner is notified if the thread is successfully moved.\\

\section{Mark solution post}
\subsection*{Description:}
This use case allows a user or an owner of a thread to choose or mark a post in that thread as being the best answer, which should then elevate that post in the thread and should make in turn make the post easily visible as one enters the thread.
\subsection{Prioritization:} 
\textbf{Nice-To-Have}: Marking a post as the best answer.
\subsection{Conditions and Data Structures:}
\subsubsection*{Pre-Conditions:}
A user must have the privileges set by the administration of a space in order to mark a post as the best answer. The user is required to be logged in.
\subsubsection*{Post-Conditions:}
The thread should effectively display that an answer has been selected and optionally close the thread. The poster of the best answer should acquire an increase in progress to the next status level.

\section{Vote and Evaluate Posts}
\subsection*{Description:}
This use case refers to the ability of a user to either vote up or down a post; a higher vote count on a post indicates the usefulness of a post. It also refers to a user being able to evaluate or give feedback on another users post.
\subsection{Prioritization:} 
\textbf{Important}: Voting on and evaluation of posts.
\subsection{Conditions and Data Structures:}
\subsubsection*{Pre-Conditions:}
A post has to have been created for a user to be able to vote on or evaluate it. Any user can vote on or evaluate a post as long as the user is logged in and a part of a specific Buzz Space. An exception to this rule is when the administration of a Buzz Space set specific rules as to which users (perhaps based on status) can vote on or evaluate posts.
\subsubsection*{Post-Conditions:}
A vote or evaluation has to be visible to every user (or only some based on the administration of that space) after it has been made on a post. A positive vote or evaluation has to reflect upon the posters progress to the next status level.

\section{Post Tagging}
\subsection*{Description:}
\textbf{Brief}:One very important functional requierment is the ability for the user to structure the information and content according to his own preferance and needs. Socilal tagging is the feaure that will enable him to do so
\subsection{Prioritization:} 
\textbf{Case-Priority - Important}: The user should be able to tag topics of   interest in the post they created, as well
as posts created by other users.
\\Social tagging saves time and keeps user up to date with latest news and post regarding tagged topics
\\Users can: 
\\View posts according to tags.
\\Sort posts according to tags.
\\Follow different authors of posts and index topics and subjects according to tags.
\subsection{Conditions and Data Structures:}
\subsubsection*{Pre-Conditions:}
\textbf A post must not have been previously marked as a tag. If there are any keywords that look like "links" and have a hash symbol infront of them within the post, that post may be seen as already tagged.
\subsubsection*{Post-Conditions:}
\textbf A post becomes a tagged post if it has words with in it that have a hash symbol in front of them.
\\ words that are tags must change colour and become links.
\\The user can now index topics, follow different authors, sort and view posts according to the tagged topics.

\section{Filter threads and buzzspaces}
\subsection*{Description:} This module provides a search and filter functionality.It allows the user to search the current Buzz Space they are in and if need be, filter the results. Users can filter the Buzz Space by tags, date,user or by user-rating. They can also search through the Buzz Space by entering a search-phrase in a search box, alternatively they can both search and filter i.e filter the search-results by tags, date, user or user-rating.\\
\subsection{Prioritization:} Since the number of threads can be infinitely high, this functionality is important when one wishes to view specific threads\\
\subsection{Conditions and Data Structures:}
\subsubsection*{Pre-Conditions:}\\
1.A specific Buzz Space has to have been created for a user to be able to search and/or filter.\\
2.The user has to atleast choose a single filter option and/or enter a search phrase\\
\subsubsection*{Post-Conditions:}\\
1.Upon clicking the submit button, the search and/or filter results will be automatically displayed for the user to see.\\
