\section{Create Thread}
\subsection*{Description:}
1.	User activates â€œCreate Threadâ€ function by selecting the â€œCreate Threadâ€ option.\\
2.	System responds by presenting user with a form to create thread topic etc\\
3.	User fills in form ïƒ  topic of thread, tags, etc and submits the form\\
4.	System reviews the submitted information and  verifies users status and privileges, decorates the thread as needed and checks that all requirements (rules) are followed by the user based on his/her status\\
5.	 System displays either an acknowledgement or error message based on the pervious checkpoint.
\subsection{Prioritization:} 
This Use case is considered Important
\subsection{Conditions and Data Structures:}
Participants:
Initiated by User and communicates with system
\subsubsection*{Pre-Conditions:}
1.	The User is logged in \\
a.	The user has a specific status
\subsubsection*{Post-Conditions:}
1.	The user fills in the form to create a new thread\\
a.	User must have a specific status in order to perform certain functions when creating a thread
\subsubsection*{Requests and Results Data Structures:}
\includegraphics{./Images/CRUDThread/Diagrams/1.png}
Status can be an abstract class and each sub-class will be a generalization of this class as each new status â€œIS-Aâ€ status.
Each user â€œHAS-Aâ€ status and thus each new user will be a composition of each specific status class.
Each thread â€œHAS-Aâ€ user that started it and thus each new thread will be a composition of each user.\\\\
Steps:\\\\
1.	If the user attempts to create a thread, the system will first check if the user is logged in.\\
1.1.	If so, it will go to number 1 above and check the users status\\
1.1.1.	The system verifies the status and at number 2 checks that the user has the privileges to create threads of the appropriate size, contents etc.\\
1.1.1.1	If the user has the necessary privileges then the thread is created at 3\\
1.1.1.2	Otherwise an error message is displayed telling the user that he/she does not have the necessary privileges \\
2.	If the user is not logged in, an error message is displayed telling the user that he/she is not logged in and it will redirect to the logging page.\\

\subsubsection*{Post-Conditions:}
1.	System displays selected thread with posts\\
2.	If user is logged on and has privileges then an attempt to make changes such as update, delete, reply, tag, rate etc will be acknowledged.

\section{Mark solution post}
\subsection*{Description:}
This use case allows a user or an owner of a thread to choose or mark a post in that thread as being the best answer, which should then elevate that post in the thread and should make in turn make the post easily visible as one enters the thread.
\subsection{Prioritization:} 
\textbf{Nice-To-Have}: Marking a post as the best answer.
\subsection{Conditions and Data Structures:}
\subsubsection*{Pre-Conditions:}
A user must have the privileges set by the administration of a space in order to mark a post as the best answer. The user is required to be logged in.
\subsubsection*{Post-Conditions:}
The thread should effectively display that an answer has been selected and optionally close the thread. The poster of the best answer should acquire an increase in progress to the next status level.

\section{Vote and Evaluate Posts}
\subsection*{Description:}
This use case refers to the ability of a user to either vote up or down a post; a higher vote count on a post indicates the usefulness of a post. It also refers to a user being able to evaluate or give feedback on another users post.
\subsection{Prioritization:} 
\textbf{Important}: Voting on and evaluation of posts.
\subsection{Conditions and Data Structures:}
\subsubsection*{Pre-Conditions:}
A post has to have been created for a user to be able to vote on or evaluate it. Any user can vote on or evaluate a post as long as the user is logged in and a part of a specific Buzz Space. An exception to this rule is when the administration of a Buzz Space set specific rules as to which users (perhaps based on status) can vote on or evaluate posts.
\subsubsection*{Post-Conditions:}
A vote or evaluation has to be visible to every user (or only some based on the administration of that space) after it has been made on a post. A positive vote or evaluation has to reflect upon the posters progress to the next status level.

\section{Post Tagging}
\subsection*{Description:}
\textbf{Brief}:One very important functional requierment is the ability for the user to structure the information and content according to his own preferance and needs. Socilal tagging is the feaure that will enable him to do so
\subsection{Prioritization:} 
\textbf{Case-Priority - Important}: The user should be able to tag topics of   interest in the post they created, as well
as posts created by other users.
\\Social tagging saves time and keeps user up to date with latest news and post regarding tagged topics
\\Users can: 
\\View posts according to tags.
\\Sort posts according to tags.
\\Follow different authors of posts and index topics and subjects according to tags.
\subsection{Conditions and Data Structures:}
\subsubsection*{Pre-Conditions:}
\textbf A post must not have been previously marked as a tag. If ther are any keywords that look like "links" and have a hash symbol infront of them within the post, that post may be seen as alrady tagged.
\subsubsection*{Post-Conditions:}
\textbf A post becomes a tagged post if it has a words with in it that have a hash symbol in front of them.
\\ words that are tags must change colour and become links.
\\The user can now index topics, follow different authors, sort and view posts according to the tagged topics.
